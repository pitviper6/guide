  "about": "As we learn more about COVID-19, a simple graph has gone viral: ‚ÄúFlatten the Curve.‚Äù Praised for shedding light on the scale and speed of the outbreak, it illustrates the wave of expected COVID-19 cases.\n\n- A high curve means the virus is spreading quickly; some people won‚Äôt get the medical care they need, and the number of deaths is likely to increase.\n- A flattened curve means COVID-19 is spreading slowly, staggering the rate of people with COVID-19 and giving doctors time to best utilize scarce resources to treat people and save lives. \n\n## Purpose\nWe can all slow the spread of COVID-19 and ‚ÄúFlatten the Curve‚Äù together. This site provides reliable information reviewed by scientists delivered in as many languages as possible to help:\n1. Understand when and how to protect ourselves;\n2. Understand how to self-isolate, quarantine, and help others stay healthy;\n3. Increase our knowledge about COVID-19 and related trends; \n4. Avoid panic and trauma by providing everyone with the right information, when we need it, and in our own language;\n5. Provide access to resources to expedite research and collaboration, such as information to participate in clinical trials.\n\nFlatten the Curve is a collective effort of people, including scientists and health experts. We are not speaking on behalf of organizations or trying to duplicate official communication channels.\n\n\n## Authors\n\nContent initially compiled by Julie McMurry, masters degree in public health from the [University of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](http://lshtm.ac.uk/) as well as a background in infectious diseases and vaccine development.

But keep in mind that over the longer term, this isolation could have\nnegative impacts on many people's mental health. Cultivating meaningful relationships is a well established but under-appreciated determinant for all health outcomes. So DO see the people you love, but consider doing so via lower-risk activities. For instance, go for a walk outside with a smaller group of people rather than attending an event indoors. Go to the beach. Ride bikes. Golf. Picnic more.

Some tips:\nWherever possible, make delivery a top priority, especially for those at highest risk, and especially in regions at the beginning of the exponential curve.\n - Go to the store at off-peak hours. \n - Make a written list, organized by location in store, so you can be efficient.\n - Retain a 6 feet (2 meters) distance between yourself and others at all times. More distance is better.\n - Phones are hard to disinfect completely; instead, while out, put your phone in a baggie (it still works this way)\n - Bring disinfectant wipes and/or wear washable cloth gardening gloves for handling doors, elevators, and other frequently touched [hard surfaces that may retain the virus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-surfaces-aerosols.html). Remember you are protecting yourself as well as others. \n - Use non-physical means to pay, such as PayPal or Apple Pay where possible. If not, use disinfecting wipes to disinfect your credit card. Don't use cash. \n - Create a decontamination protocol and location for your home, where you can either quarantine for >72 hrs at room temperature (easiest) or disinfect all items (with wipes, bleach, hydrogen peroxide, or alcohol; or washed with soap and water in the case of vegetables) that may have come in contact with other people. Inner items can be carefully removed and placed in a clean bag or box, and brought inside by having one hand be considered contaminated while the other is clean; alternatively, two people in the same home can operate similarly, one tasked with 'dirty' items and the other 'clean' items. \n - Leave your shoes outside when you return\n",

Part time WFH is better than none. Don't wait for your employer to mandate\nWFH for everyone. Ask your manager if it would be permissible for you personally. Encourage your colleagues.\n\nIf you can WFH, do it *precisely* because your barber, your kid's teacher, your local restaurant staff, your barista, and your doctors etc. can not.\n\nGreat software now makes distance collaboration easier than ever. My personal favorites are below.

  "keep-your-home-clean": "{:.only_toc}\n### Your home\n\n{:.do.no_toc}\n### Keep your home clean and develop routines for coming back\n\nI'm developing guidance on this right now and others are welcome to weigh in, but a few things off the top of my head: If you have the ability to do so, consider a 'staging' area for clean entry into your home. Remove shoes, outerwear. If you work in a high risk environment like a hospital, nursing home, etc, wash your clothes immediately and then dry them at high heat or at least dry in the sunshine. Wash hands right away. Isolate your mail, packages and purchases (including food) before bringing them into the house and leave them isolated a few hours at a minimum. If you are in an especially high risk group, you might want to consider leaving goods isolated a longer time (a few days) and avoid eating raw produce, and also decontaminating products that come into your house.\nThe latest [research](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.09.20033217v1.full.pdf) shows that the virus can survive up to 4 hours on copper surfaces, up to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel, and up to 24 hours on cardboard.\n\\[guidance needed as to how best to do this; what potency of bleach solution/duration etc?\\].\n",

Stock the room in advance with food that the infected person can consume with zero preparation and without face-to-face interaction with others. If you have a dedicated bathroom for the infected person, that is best. Realistically, given shortages you won't have access to a surgical mask, but if you do have one, prioritize its use on the infected person rather than caretakers. Consider use of a cloth mask for the infected person as well as for the uninfected in the same household.\n",
  "wear-a-mask-when-in-public": "{:.do}\n### Wear a facemask when in public\n\nStudies have shown for Influenza that a mask may have a self-protection benefit. The viron that causes COVID-19 is roughly the same size as the Influenza viron at 125 nanometers and it has the same mechanisms of entering the human body. If you absolutely have to venture into public where other people may be, buy a cloth mask or make your own as US hospital chains are beginning to do. \n\nDeaconess Health Systems shares a cloth mask design as part of their appeal for cloth masks (March 20): [PDF](https://www.deaconess.com/How-to-make-a-Face-Mask/Documents-Mask/Mask-Information) and [Video](https://youtu.be/9tBg0Os5FWQ).\n\nProvidence health services group shares a cloth mask design video (March 21) as part of their \"100 million mask\" initiative: [Video](https://vimeo.com/399324367/13cd93f150).\n",

I've stopped wearing rings for that same reason; I don't know that there's been a formal study on this ring idea.\n\nOnly if you are in a financial and operational position to do so, consider temporarily tutoring or home schooling, or even just keeping kids home from after-school activities or for part of the school day.Don't compromise your kids' education, but every little bit of distancing helps.

Don't believe individuals who say that crystals, essential oils, etc. have helped them; the folks sharing these products may have the best intentions, or they may be predatory. But the idea is the same: many patients spontaneously do get better on their own because most cases are mild and resolve without pharmaceutical intervention.

Time will tell.\n\nMoreover, even IF the true Covid-19 mortality rate is as low as 1% ([as it is so far with the Diamond Princess](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0452_article)), that would already be [ten times higher than a typical seasonal flu](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu).\n\n![Bar chart showing COVID-19 mortality rate estimated between 0.5% and 4.0%, versus Seasonal Flu at 0.1%](images/mortality-rate.svg)\n\n> The 61,099 flu-related deaths in the U.S. during the severe flu season of 2017-2018 amounted to 0.14% of the estimated 44.8 million cases of influenza-like illness. There were also an estimated flu-related 808,129 hospitalizations, for a rate of 1.8%. Assume a Covid-19 outbreak of similar size in the U.S., multiply the death and hospitalization estimates by five or 10, and you get some really scary numbers: 300,000 to 600,000 deaths, and [4 million to 8 million hospitalizations in a country that has 924,107 staffed hospital beds](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-05/how-bad-is-the-coronavirus-let-s-compare-with-sars-ebola-flu) \\[for all illnesses combined\\].\n\nFor most people, infection results in a mild but still transmissible illness; **that is how it spreads.** Those that get severe illness are hit really hard.
